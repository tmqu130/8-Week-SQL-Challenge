--Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
--Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

--To check the subscription information of customers, I join the subscriptions (sample) table with the plans table (looking at the information through plan_name will be easier to understand than plan_id).

--Sort the query results by each customer_id and in ascending order of start_date:

select 
    customer_id, 
    P.plan_id, 
    plan_name, 
    start_date
from foodie_fi.plans as P
join foodie_fi.subscriptions_samples as SS 
    on P.plan_id = SS.plan_id
order by 
    customer_id, 
    start_date;
